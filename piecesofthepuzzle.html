              <p>We have come up with four main pieces to the college experience. The WVU Experience is comprised of four parts:  Academics, Well Being, Professional and Social. Every student can relate to some piece of The Experience, and we believe there is much work to do to enhance these areas.</p>

              <p>For the <strong>Academic</strong> piece, we want to highlight student achievements during the Week of Honors with recognition dinners within each College. In addition to the Week of Honors, we want to continue current efforts with tutoring and academic advising.</p>

              <p>For the <strong>Well Being</strong> piece, we are working with the University to institute a traumatic student policy. The policy would be incorporated into University syllabi and would aid students who experience a traumatic event that is beyond their control, such as a long-term illness or death in the family. The policy would alleviate the stress of falling behind in classes while managing personal crises.</p>

            <p>For the <strong>Professional</strong> piece, we plan to create a platform for students to use to make stronger connections with University alumni. WVU has one of the strongest alumni bases in the country. We would like to connect them with students to foster mentorship.</p>

              <p>For the <strong>Social</strong> piece, we would like to bring SpringFest to campus. This could be a way to welcome students who start school in the spring, but also serve as a way to invite students to celebrate and have fun in a respectful and positive manner. SpringFest would be the perfect way to highlight student talent, and bring in some national talent, too.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center">Vision</h2><p>We want to see a Student Government that doesn’t just limit itself to a few issues. Student Government should encompass each and every part of your college experience, while still being able to get the job done. Student Government isn't here to build resumes, govern students or make empty promises. Rather, we’re here to bring about real change to WVU and represent your college experience. Everyone’s experience is different. We all face different issues, and we all have different passions. If you’re not limiting yourself, why should SGA? Our candidates have held various leadership roles outside of SGA – which is exactly what Student Government needs. We will bring a fresh perspective to SGA, one that is able to bring about real change to campus, and serve our diverse student body.</p>

              <h2 class="text-center">Mission</h2><p>We are dedicated to making an open and transparent Student Government students can rely on. We recognize that in order to be successful, student government has to listen before speaking, create feasible goals and, most importantly, represent your voice. We have a team of student leaders from various experiences across campus, who are ready to serve you. The Experience isn’t a group of politicians trying to win you over with some free stuff. We are a group of passionate students who have a heart for serving WVU. We’re simply sharing our ideas and listening to yours, while having fun and offering some free food in the process (because, let’s be real, free food should be part of everyone’s college experience). </p>
